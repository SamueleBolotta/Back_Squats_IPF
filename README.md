# Back_Squats_IPF

## Project Overview

This project aims at creating a neural network that can assess the validity of a back squat. A valid back squat occurs when the crease of the hip is below the kneecap. The dataset was constructed with hundreds of images of powerlifting athletes - trying to achieve balance in terms of gender, skin colour and weight category. 

The labels are three: 
- "valid" when the IPF (International Powerlifting Federation) referees gave a white light to the lift from that specific perspective (i.e. frontal or semi-lateral)
- "parallel" when the IPF referees gave a red light to the lift from that specific perspective
- "above parallel" when the athlete was clearly above the parallel
